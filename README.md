# Navigator.nvim

A minimalist Neovim plugin for file navigation, built because I needed a faster alternative to [ThePrimeagenâ€™s Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon). When working on a network file system, Harpoonâ€™s constant writing to save cursor positions slowed things down too much. Navigator skips that overhead, focusing on simple bookmarking and jumping between files in your current directory.

## Highlights

- Bookmark files without cursor position tracking.
- Saves bookmarks between sessions and per folder.
- Floating window for managing bookmarks.
- Optional lualine integration with custom labels.
- No default keybindingsâ€”you decide how to use it.

## Commands

- `:NavOpen` - Show the bookmark window.
- `:NavAdd` - Bookmark the current file.
- `:NavClear` - Wipe all bookmarks.
- `:NavPrint` - Debug the bookmark list.

## Installation

### With [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
return {
  {
    "leosmaia21/navigator.nvim",
    config = function()
      require("navigator").setup({
        showjumpkeys = true,
        lualine_keys = {"q", "w", "e", "r"},
      })
      -- Example keymaps (set your own):
      vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>n", ":NavOpen<CR>", { desc = "Open Navigator" })
      vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>a", ":NavAdd<CR>", { desc = "Add file" })
      vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", function() require("navigator").goto(1) end, { desc = "Go to file q" })
    end,
    cmd = { "NavOpen", "NavAdd", "NavClear", "NavPrint" },
    dependencies = { "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim" }, -- Optional
  },
}
```

### Optional lualine setup

For integrating Navigator.nvim with [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim), you can add the following configuration:

```lua
require("lualine").setup({
  sections = {
    lualine_c = { require("navigator").lualine },
  },
})
```

This will display Navigator's bookmarks in the lualine status bar.
